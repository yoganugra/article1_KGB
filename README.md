**Gawi-Bawi-Bo**

Gawi-Bawi-Bo is a hand game usually played between two or more people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. Before starting the game, they usually say “안 내면 술래 … 가위바위보”. It means, if you don’t show your hand, then you are it (you lose). These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors". This Python Program [Mini Project] is aimed at automating one of the player called as Computerized Player and the taking rock, paper or scissor as an input from the user.
